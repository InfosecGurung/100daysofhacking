# #100DaysOfHacking
Documenting my 100DaysOfHacking journey, inspired by [@harshbothra_](https://twitter.com/harshbothra_) 365 days of learning.

(I started this from Day 15)

**Day 15 - Learnt how to SSH in another machine in a LAN environment.**
- followed [Zach Duey's](https://dev.to/zduey) dev.to [article](https://dev.to/zduey/how-to-set-up-an-ssh-server-on-a-home-computer)
- for creating an SSH key and transferring it to the host, referred to [this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys#keys-with-specific-commands) article in Ubuntu wiki and [ssh.com](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/copy-id/).
- secured the SSH server by reading [Sunil's article](https://dev.to/sunil/top-10-tips-to-secure-ssh-your-server-2jab) and [maketecheasier's article](https://www.maketecheasier.com/secure-ssh-server-ubuntu/)

**Day 16 - Reinstalled Manjaro i3 edition because messed up some system configs**
- An interesting thing of dmenu not working maybe due to setting India UTF-8 local font settings? Still, solved this issue by referring [stackoverflow](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/573748/manjaro-i3-fresh-install-dmenu-not-working)
- did some of the [30 things to do after installing manjaro](https://averagelinuxuser.com/manjaro-xfce-after-install/)
- had to reconfigure SSH :/

**Day 17 - Read and did some hands-on till the text-fu section of [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/)**

**Day 18 - Linux - file descriptors; /dev/null file**
- Read about file description from [this](https://www.bottomupcs.com/file_descriptors.xhtml) and it is from [bottomupcs](https://www.bottomupcs.com/) book ([pdf](https://www.bottomupcs.com/csbu.pdf)). This will be a great one for a #100DaysOfOS, where OS = operating system.
- Learnt about what "2>&1" means and why it is used from Igor's [dev.to article](https://dev.to/iggredible/what-does-2-1-mean-290), Brian Storti's [article](https://www.brianstorti.com/understanding-shell-script-idiom-redirect/) and [superuser.com](https://superuser.com/questions/71428/what-does-21-do-in-command-line) (the second answer) is pretty deatiled with the basics too.
- Started with this [Linux Security course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-linux-security-hardening-with-practical-examples/) in Udemy and completed till section 4. 
- Learnt about `/etc` file and about how it can be configured. `/etc/passwd` and 'etc/shadow' is some important, it seems xD

**Day 19 - spent time travelling, so could only learn about user related permissions**
- From this [Linux Security course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-linux-security-hardening-with-practical-examples/) course, I learnt about the `chage` cmd and about `/etc/login.defs` file.
