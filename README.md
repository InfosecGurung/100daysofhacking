## Hey there!
#### This is a repo of me learning subjects/topics I want to learn outside of my uni courses.

I had taken the #100DaysOfHacking challenge in Twitter, but couldn't complete it :/
Although, I learned some cool things like how to SSH in a LAN machine, Networking (from TryHackMe), using Nmap, and so on and so forth. Was travelling when day 19 and 20 came, so the streak ended.

But, I learned a lesson from this experience and that is "hacking" is a *very vast field* (I knew it before too, but didn't feel it firsthand). In those 19 days, I struggled as to which topic to study and learn since I didn't have a path.

So, what I have decided is that I'll focus on a subject or two for atleast a month or so to get a gist of it. I don't know if I'll be continuing that topic after that or not. It depends.

Gonna start with Operating System (because why not? xD).
Let's go April 2021!!

Will write my daily logs in [here.](http://github.com/InfosecGurung/100daysofhacking/learnOS)
