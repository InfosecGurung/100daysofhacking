# #100DaysOfHacking
Documenting my 100DaysOfHacking journey, inspired by [@harshbothra_](https://twitter.com/harshbothra_) 365 days of learning.

(I started this from Day 15)

**Day 15 - Learnt how to SSH in another machine in a LAN environment.**
- followed [Zach Duey's](https://dev.to/zduey) dev.to article
- for creating an SSH key and transferring it to the host, referred to [this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys#keys-with-specific-commands) article in Ubuntu wiki and [ssh.com](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/copy-id/).
- secured the SSH server by reading [Sunil's article](https://dev.to/sunil/top-10-tips-to-secure-ssh-your-server-2jab) and [maketecheasier's article](https://www.maketecheasier.com/secure-ssh-server-ubuntu/)

**Day 16 - Reinstalled Manjaro i3 edition because messed up some system configs**
- An interesting thing of dmenu not working maybe due to setting India UTF-8 local font settings? Still, solved this issue by referring [stackoverflow](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/573748/manjaro-i3-fresh-install-dmenu-not-working)
- did some of the [30 things to do after installing manjaro](https://averagelinuxuser.com/manjaro-xfce-after-install/)
- had to reconfigure SSH :/
