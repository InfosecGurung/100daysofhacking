# #100DaysOfHacking
Documenting my 100DaysOfHacking journey, inspired by [@harshbothra_](htpps://twitter.com/harshbothra_) 365 days of learning.

(I started this from Day 15)

Day 15 - Learnt how to SSH in another machine in a LAN environment.
- followed [Zach Duey's](https://dev.to/zduey) dev.to article
- for creating an SSH key and transferring it to the host, referred to [this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys#keys-with-specific-commands) article in Ubuntu wiki and [ssh.com](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/copy-id/).
- secured the SSH server by reading [Sunil's article](https://dev.to/sunil/top-10-tips-to-secure-ssh-your-server-2jab) and [maketecheasier's article](https://www.maketecheasier.com/secure-ssh-server-ubuntu/)
